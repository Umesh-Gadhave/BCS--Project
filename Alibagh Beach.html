<P> Just 120 kms. away from Mumbai, Kihim is an exclusive beach, laced with lush coconut trees. The inviting part of it is that Kihim is entirely undiscovered and unpolluted beach. Its surroundings are attractive - Murud Beach and Chaul, historic forts, churches, synagogues and fascinating tower of St. Barbara.

At Kihim, you have an unconventional M. T. D. C.’s ‘Tent Holiday’ with modern facilities. If you want to experience real change, stay in the tents and take experience of tranquility. Body and mind tired by stress and tension of the city life will be put to rest here.

Devotees of nature can get plentiful things done. Dense forest adorned by wild flowers, butterflies dancing on them, birds charms tourists. Chaul, historically important place is just 15 kilometer away. Remains of portuguese rule, ancient caves of Budha’s era, Juna Humamkhana, churches are worth to visit.

Alibag Beach:
