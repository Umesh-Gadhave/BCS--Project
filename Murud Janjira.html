 Janjira fort is one of the many forts across Maharashtra situated in Raigad district along the western coast. This fort stands apart from the others due to its history and structure. Janjira is the only kind of oval shaped fort in Maharashtra for which it is long known by the masses around the territory even today. Malik Akbar, a minister from the legendary Nizamshahi Empire, constructed the fort. This fort was built as an emergence during war times for the Nizamshahi families. It took about 22 years to complete the construction of the unique oval shaped fort on the 17th century as it occupies about 22 acres in the middle of the ocean. This fort is integral in its place even in the 21st century besides the severe attack of the rigid winds and tide as a credit to the ancient engineering. The fort use to contain all the necessary facilities in stock that are required to the king and his ministers to stay for at least 2 years.

 

The fort has an interesting history that makes it special as compared to other forts in Maharashtra. Shivaji was a successful emperor in Maharashtra who has conquered many forts in the state but was ineffective in acquiring the Janjira fort despite many attempts. Even after the regime of Shivaji, his son Sambhaji failed to conquer the Janjira fort despite of using unique strategy of acquiring the fort. Later Sambhaji went on to construct a new fort at a distance of seven kilometers to plan strategies to conquer Janjira.
