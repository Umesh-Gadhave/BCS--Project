Driving on the way to Shiroda from Vengurla just turn to the right at Ubhadanda you will see the huge streteh of shiny silvery sand dunes. By trampling the sand under the foot, a short walk, climbing the sand dunes and   lo behold you are at the sparkling beach and crystal blue waters of Sagreshwar. This beautiful beach is just 3-4 kms from Vengurla. A small temple of Sagareshwara(Lord of the Sea) is situated on the beach.

The Cajuring plantations on the beach offers hospitality and pleasure to the tourists. Ideal for swimming, this is a secluded beach and can be accessed by trekking.
